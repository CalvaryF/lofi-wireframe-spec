# Design Task: User Profile Settings Flow

## Brief

Design a **3-screen mobile flow** for editing user profile settings. The flow should feel cohesive and guide users through viewing and editing their profile information.

## Screens Required

### 1. Profile Overview
- Display user's profile information (name, email, avatar placeholder, bio)
- Show account stats or activity summary
- Provide clear entry point to edit profile
- Include navigation (back button, maybe settings icon)

### 2. Edit Profile
- Form-like layout for editing profile fields
- Fields: Name, Email, Bio/About, maybe notification preferences
- Clear save/cancel actions
- Visual hierarchy that groups related fields

### 3. Success/Confirmation
- Confirm changes were saved
- Provide clear next action (return to profile, continue to settings, etc.)
- Brief, reassuring message

## Constraints

- **Size**: 400x700 pixels (mobile portrait)
- **Style**: Low-fidelity wireframe (outlines, no colors)
- **Annotations**: Add 2-3 annotations per screen explaining key UI decisions

## Iteration Limits

- **Maximum iterations**: 5
- **Stop when**: You're satisfied with the flow and all 3 screens work together cohesively

## Deliverables

After each iteration:
1. Save spec to `specs/v{N}.yaml`
2. Render to `renders/v{N}/`
3. Inspect all 3 screen images
4. Note what works and what to improve

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 3 screens render without errors
- [ ] Visual consistency across screens (similar header style, spacing, etc.)
- [ ] Clear user flow from overview → edit → confirmation
- [ ] Annotations explain the key design decisions
- [ ] Layout is balanced and readable

## Getting Started

1. Read `INSTRUCTIONS.md` for API usage and spec format
2. Look at `example.yaml` for syntax reference
3. Start with a simple v1 that has basic structure for all 3 screens
4. Iterate to refine layout, add details, improve annotations

Good luck!
